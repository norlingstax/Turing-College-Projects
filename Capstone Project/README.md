# Capstone Project: Banner Performance Analysis

This capstone project involves analysing user behaviour and banner performance for an online sporting goods store. The analysis focuses on identifying key patterns in user interactions, retention, and conversion rates to provide actionable recommendations for optimising banner campaigns. The project uses exploratory data analysis, cohort analysis, funnel analysis, and A/B testing to deliver insights and propose data-driven strategies.

### Key Components

#### **1. Data Exploration and Cleaning**
- **Objective**: Ensure the dataset is prepared for analysis.
- Checked for missing values.
- Standardised column names and extracted temporal features (e.g., hour, weekday, month).
- Segmented data by platform, product category, and event type for focused analysis.

#### **2. Retention and Cohort Analysis**
- **Objective**: Examine retention trends and repurchase behaviours.
- Monthly and weekly retention rates calculated to track user engagement over time.
- Identified drop-offs in retention and highlighted gaps compared to industry benchmarks.

#### **3. Funnel Analysis**
- **Objective**: Evaluate user journeys from banner show to purchase.
- Analysed conversion rates (CVR) across platforms and product categories.
- Identified major drop-offs at each funnel stage and highlighted anomalies.

#### **4. A/B Testing**
- **Objective**: Measure the impact of different banner strategies.
- Tested conversion and click-through rates (CTR) across product categories and platforms.
- Verified the statistical significance of results to ensure actionable insights.

#### **5. Time-Based Conversion Analysis**
- **Objective**: Identify optimal timing for banner visibility.
- Examined weekday and hourly trends, highlighting late-night peaks for conversions.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Skills Acquired

#### **1. Data Cleaning and Manipulation**
- Applied data cleaning techniques, including validation of event consistency.
- Used Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy) for efficient data manipulation.

#### **2. Cohort Analysis and Retention Insights**
- Conducted cohort analysis to evaluate retention and repurchase rates.
- Benchmarked retention and repurchase rates against industry standards to identify improvement areas.

#### **3. Funnel Analysis**
- Mapped user journeys and calculated stage-wise conversion rates.
- Detected platform-specific anomalies (e.g., desktop orders exceeding clicks).

#### **4. A/B Testing**
- Used statistical methods to ensure the validity and significance of findings.
- Highlighted differences in platform and product performance to tailor strategies.

#### **5. Visualisation, Reporting, and Presentation**
- Created a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to summarise key metrics.
- Used Matplotlib to generate clear, data-driven visualisations.
- Delivered insights through narrative-driven slides and a detailed written report for stakeholders.
