# Module 1, Sprint 3: SQL and Databases

This project focused on SQL and database management. The objective was to explore the **AdventureWorks 2005** database, identify required data, and retrieve it using SQL queries. This sprint provided an opportunity to apply fundamental SQL skills and build a solid foundation for more advanced topics in subsequent sprints.

## üìã Project Overview

### Objective
- Explore the **AdventureWorks 2005** database using **Google BigQuery**.
- Write optimised SQL queries to extract, join, and analyse data.
- Validate and debug queries written by peers.

### Tasks
The sprint was divided into three main sections:

1. **Overview of Products**:
   - Extract product details with subcategories.
   - Add product category names and filter for high-priced items (e.g., premium bikes).

2. **Reviewing Work Orders**:
   - Aggregate work order data and calculate costs for January 2004.
   - Analyse trends such as average time between start and end dates.

3. **Query Validation**:
   - Debug and improve faulty queries for specific business use cases.
   - Enhance query readability and performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Skills Acquired

### SQL Fundamentals
- **Data Extraction**: Used `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER BY` clauses to retrieve and sort data.
- **Joins**: Utilised `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` to combine tables based on primary and foreign keys.
- **Aggregations**: Performed operations such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, and `GROUP BY` for summarising data.
- **Filtering**: Applied conditions to filter data effectively (e.g., filtering products by price or orders by cost).

### Query Validation and Debugging
- Identified and resolved issues in SQL queries provided by peers.
- Improved query readability and debugging by:
  - Using meaningful table aliases.
  - Structuring joins logically.
  - Implementing comments for better clarity.

### Advanced Query Concepts
- Used aggregation techniques (e.g., grouping data) to summarise information.
- Applied conditional filters and `HAVING` clauses for targeted data extraction.
- Simplified and optimised queries for better performance.

### Soft Skills
- Gained experience in giving and receiving constructive feedback through peer reviews.
- Presented and defended the project during the Senior Team Lead review, demonstrating communication and analytical skills.
