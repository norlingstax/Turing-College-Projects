### Specialisation: Product Analyst

This project focused on analysing how long it takes users to make a purchase from the moment they land on the website. The goal was to calculate daily conversion durations and explore behavioural patterns across different user segments.

üìã **Project Overview**

**Objective**
- Measure the average time (in minutes) from a user's first interaction on a website to their first purchase, calculated daily.
- Break down and compare conversion times by platform, weekday, and user type (new vs returning).
- Present findings with visualisations and support them with analytical commentary.

**Tasks**

**Data Extraction and SQL Analysis:**
- Used multiple CTEs to calculate first daily event and first purchase per user.
- Calculated average conversion time per day.
- Segmented conversion duration by:
  - **Platform** (desktop vs mobile)
  - **Day of the week**
  - **User type** (new vs returning), including a version with downsampling to correct sample imbalance.

**Visualisation and Presentation:**
- Created clear and engaging visualisations to communicate daily and segmented trends.
- Highlighted statistically significant differences using A/B testing (e.g., new vs returning users).
- Explored outliers and behavioural insights.

**Insights & Observations**
- Conversion time fluctuates daily with no stable pattern, but a downward trend was observed in late January.
- Midweek users take longer to convert, while weekends show faster purchases.
- No significant difference between mobile and desktop users.
- Returning users convert significantly faster than new users, confirmed via statistical testing.
- Outliers likely indicate passive browsing or prolonged hesitation before purchasing.

üõ†Ô∏è **Key Skills Acquired**

**SQL for Behavioural Analysis**
- Used nested CTEs and timestamp functions to calculate user-level metrics.
- Segmented results by time, device, and user type.

**Data Visualisation and Storytelling**
- Created clean visualisations using MS Excel.
- Used data storytelling techniques to clearly communicate insights.

**Analytical Thinking**
- Identified actionable opportunities to reduce conversion times.
- Accounted for data quality, outliers, and sample bias in the analysis.

üåü **Key Takeaways**

This sprint improved my ability to:
- Use SQL to extract meaningful behavioural metrics from event-level data.
- Structure a data-driven narrative around user conversion time.
- Communicate insights clearly with visual aids and thoughtful recommendations.
