## üìå Capstone Project: Advanced Data Analytics

In this final project, I applied the full spectrum of skills gained during the Turing College curriculum to analyse banner performance and user behaviour for an online sporting goods store. 
The analysis focused on retention trends, funnel optimisation, A/B testing, and time-based insights to inform business strategies.

### Key Skills:
- Retention and cohort analysis to evaluate user engagement and repurchase trends.
- Funnel analysis to identify drop-offs and platform/product-specific anomalies.
- A/B testing to validate platform and product performance differences.
- Time-based insights to optimise campaign timing.

Deliverables included an interactive Power BI dashboard, a written report, and presentation slides that combined actionable recommendations with clear storytelling.
