## üìö Module 1: Introduction to Data Analytics
### Sprints:
1. **SQL Basics**: Learned SQL fundamentals, including data retrieval, filtering, and aggregation.
2. **Advanced SQL**: Worked on more complex queries, joins, subqueries, and CTEs.

### Key Skills:
- Mastery of SQL for data extraction and manipulation.
- Understanding of relational databases and query optimization.
- Ability to translate business problems into actionable SQL queries.

## üìä Module 3: Main Analysis Types
### Sprints:
1. **Retention, Cohorts, and Churn**: Analysed user retention and churn with cohort analysis.
2. **Funnels**: Built and visualised user funnels to identify drop-off points.
3. **CLV, Customer Segmentation, and RFM**: Implemented RFM analysis, customer segmentation and calculated Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
4. **Statistical Inference and A/B Testing**: Conducted hypothesis testing and provided data-driven recommendations.

### Key Skills:
- Advanced SQL for complex data analysis.
- Proficiency in cohort analysis, RFM segmentation, and statistical testing.
- Ability to extract actionable insights for marketing, product, and business teams.

## üêç Module 4: Python for Data Analytics
### Sprints:
1. **First Steps Into Programming**: Built foundational Python programming skills through practical tasks.
2. **Data Processing with Pandas**: Performed data cleaning and analysis using Pandas.
3. **Data Visualisation with Python**: Visualised data with Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover patterns and insights.
4. **Machine Learning**: Implemented logistic regression to predict outcomes and evaluated model performance.

### Key Skills:
- Proficiency in Python for data analysis and visualisation.
- Advanced data manipulation with Pandas and NumPy.
- Understanding of machine learning basics and logistic regression modeling.

## üìà Specialization: Product Analyst

Analysed time-to-conversion by calculating the average duration from a user's first session to their first purchase on the same day. 
Explored how conversion time varies by platform (mobile vs desktop), day of the week, and user type (new vs returning). 
Presented insights with Looker Studio and evaluated sample size imbalances using random sampling techniques.

### Key Skills:
- Advanced SQL (CTEs, timestamp manipulation, case conditions).
- Behavioural analysis to identify platform and weekday conversion trends.
- Effective data presentation and business-focused storytelling.

## üìå Capstone Project

In this final project, I applied the full spectrum of skills gained during the Turing College curriculum to analyse banner performance and user behaviour for an online sporting goods store. 
The analysis focused on retention trends, funnel optimisation, A/B testing, and time-based insights to inform business strategies.

### Key Skills:
- Retention and cohort analysis to evaluate user engagement and repurchase trends.
- Funnel analysis to identify drop-offs and platform/product-specific anomalies.
- A/B testing to validate platform and product performance differences.
- Time-based insights to optimise campaign timing.

Deliverables included an interactive Power BI dashboard, a written report, and presentation slides that combined actionable recommendations with clear storytelling.
