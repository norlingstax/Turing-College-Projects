# Module 3, Sprint 1: Retention, Cohorts, and Churn

This project focused on analysing subscription retention and churn using cohort analysis. The goal was to calculate weekly retention rates for subscribers over a six-week period, providing insights to improve customer retention strategies.

## üìã Project Overview

### Objective
- Analyse weekly retention cohorts of subscribers to identify trends and insights into subscription behaviour.
- Use SQL to extract, process, and analyse data from the **subscriptions** table.
- Create clear visualisations to communicate retention patterns effectively.

### Tasks
1. Write SQL queries to:
   - Define weekly subscription cohorts based on the subscription start date.
   - Calculate the number of active subscribers for each cohort over the first six weeks of subscription.
   - Determine retention percentages for each cohort relative to the first week (week 0).
2. Create visualisations (e.g., heatmaps or line charts) to display retention trends across cohorts.
3. Provide recommendations to improve retention based on the findings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Skills Acquired

### Advanced SQL Techniques
- **Cohort Analysis**:
  - Grouped subscribers into cohorts based on their subscription start week.
  - Calculated weekly retention using logical conditions for active subscriptions.
- **Efficient Query Design**:
  - Simplified complex logic into concise and readable SQL code.
  - Avoided overcomplicating queries by leveraging functions like `date_trunc`, `countif`, and `date_add`.

### Analytical and Insight-Driven Approach
- Identified patterns in retention and churn rates across different cohorts.
- Provided actionable recommendations to improve subscription retention.

### Data Visualisation and Communication
- Designed visualisations to clearly display retention trends over time.
- Presented insights in a structured manner to support decision-making.

### Soft Skills
- Defended the project during peer and Senior Team Lead reviews, demonstrating analytical thinking and clear communication.
- Provided constructive feedback to peers, helping refine their cohort analysis approaches.
