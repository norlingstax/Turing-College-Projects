# Module 3, Sprint 2: Funnels

This project focused on analysing user behaviour through funnels to understand conversion paths. The objective was to clean raw event data, construct user funnels, and provide insights into how users interact with a subscription-based business.

## üìã Project Overview

### Objective
- Create a funnel chart to analyse user behaviour at key events (e.g., session start, view item, add to cart, purchase).
- Segment funnel analysis by the top three countries to identify regional differences in user behaviour.
- Provide actionable insights to improve user conversion and engagement.

### Tasks
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Remove duplicates from the raw events table.
   - Select relevant event types and filter out unnecessary columns.
2. **Funnel Construction**:
   - Count unique users at each stage of the funnel (all-time and monthly).
   - Segment users by the top three countries based on the number of events.
   - Pivot data for a clear funnel comparison across countries.
3. **Visualisation**:
   - Create a funnel chart and summarise key findings for presentation.
4. **Analysis**:
   - Identify potential drop-off points and provide recommendations to improve conversions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Skills Acquired

### Advanced SQL Techniques
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Applied `group by` with aggregation functions (`min`, `count`, etc.) to remove duplicates and standardise the dataset.
- **Funnel Construction**:
  - Filtered and segmented data to count unique users at key funnel stages.
  - Used pivot logic to compare funnel performance across top countries.
- **Efficient Query Design**:
  - Designed modular and readable queries to handle a large dataset effectively.

### Analytical and Communication Skills
- Identified critical drop-off points in the funnel and provided actionable insights to improve conversion.
- Presented findings in a clear and structured manner to support decision-making.

### Soft Skills
- Successfully defended the project during peer and Senior Team Lead reviews, demonstrating analytical thinking and clear communication.
- Provided constructive feedback to peers, helping refine their funnel analyses.
