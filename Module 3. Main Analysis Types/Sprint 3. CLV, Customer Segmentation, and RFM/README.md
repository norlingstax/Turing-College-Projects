# Module 3, Sprint 3: CLV, Customer Segmentation, and RFM

This project focused on calculating **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**, performing **RFM analysis**, and segmenting customers to provide actionable insights. The goal was to enable better targeting of customer groups and to understand revenue trends through cohort analysis.

## üìã Project Overview

### Objective
1. **RFM Analysis**:
   - Calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) scores for each customer.
   - Segment customers into meaningful groups based on their RFM scores.
   - Provide insights into which customer segments the marketing team should prioritise.
   - Present findings with an interactive dashboard.

2. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**:
   - Perform cohort-based analysis to calculate weekly revenue per user registration.
   - Analyse cumulative and predicted revenue trends for cohorts up to 12 weeks after registration.
   - Use SQL to extract and calculate metrics, presenting the results in detailed visualisations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Skills Acquired

### Advanced SQL Techniques
- **RFM Analysis**:
  - Used SQL to calculate R, F, and M scores from transaction data.
  - Efficiently implemented quartile-based segmentation using `APPROX_QUANTILES` for assigning RFM scores.
  - Combined SQL with Python to create 7 customer segments based on RFM scores.
- **Cohort-Based CLV**:
  - Created weekly cohorts based on user registration dates.
  - Calculated average revenue per registration and cumulative revenue trends for each cohort.
  - Designed efficient queries to handle complex aggregations and transformations.

### Data Visualisation and Segmentation
- Designed a Power BI dashboard for RFM analysis, visualising:
  - Total sales, customer counts, and average RFM metrics.
  - Customer segment distributions and their RFM characteristics.
- Created detailed visualisations for CLV analysis:
  - Weekly and cumulative revenue by cohort.
  - Predicted revenue trends using cohort-based growth rates.

### Analytical and Communication Skills
- Provided actionable insights into customer behaviour and revenue patterns.
- Delivered clear recommendations for targeting key customer segments and optimising CLV.

### Soft Skills
- Successfully defended the project during peer and Senior Team Lead reviews.
- Collaborated effectively by providing and incorporating feedback.
